<DIV ID="lt">
<p>The Lotus Temple, located in South Delhi, is a Baháí House of Worship that was dedicated in December
1986. Notable for its flowerlike shape, it has become a prominent attraction in the city. Lotus Temple is not
only a symbol of excellence in modern Indian architecture but also one of the most visited religious
buildings in the world. <br><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/New_Delhi_Lotus.jpg"width="332" height="205"><br>
Lotus temple has an expressionist architecture and this temple consists of 27 free-standing petals which
includes a central prayer hall, walkways, ground with ponds, and a greenhouse. The Lotus consists of 3
rows of 9 petals. The first 2 rows point up and reach 34 metres at their highest point. The 3rd row curls
outwards, giving the temple a sense of openness. The petals are used as awnings.<br>

The surface of the Lotus Temple is made of concrete and white marble from Penteli mountain in Greece.
This temple has a uniqueness. Like all other Bahá í Houses of Worship, the Lotus Temple is open to all,
regardless of religion or any other qualification and it is also dedicated to the oneness of religions and
humanity.
